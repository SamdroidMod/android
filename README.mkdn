Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the LeshaK's trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/SamdroidMod/android.git -b froyo

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
